# AI-Driven Disease Outbreak Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict disease outbreaks based on historical data, environmental conditions, and socio-economic factors. By analyzing patterns and trends, the model aims to provide early warnings and actionable insights for public health management.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalizing datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, correlations, and geographic distributions.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implementing machine learning models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- **Result Visualization**: Generating heatmaps, graphs, and geographical maps for insights.
